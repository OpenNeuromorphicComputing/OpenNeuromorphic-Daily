### [Stochastic Dynamics of Diffusive Memristor Blocks for Neuromorphic Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03700v1)
**2026-02-03** | *Wendy Otieno, Alex Gabbitas, Debi Pattnaik et al.*

> Biological systems use neural circuits to integrate input information and produce outputs. Synaptic convergence, where multiple neurons converge their inputs onto a single downstream neuron, is common in natural neural circuits. However, understanding specific computations performed by such neural blocks and implementating them in hardware requires further research. This work focuses on synaptic convergence in a simplified circuit of three spiking artificial neurons based on diffusive memristors. Numerical modelling and experiments reveal input voltage combinations that enable targeted activation of spiking for specific neuron configurations. We analyse the statistical characteristics of spiking patterns and interpret them from a computational perspective. The numerical simulations match experimental measurements. Our findings contribute to development of universal functional blocks for neuromorphic systems.

### [Towards Polyoxometalate Nanoelectronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03512v1)
**2026-02-03** | *Dominique Vuillaume, Anna Proust*

> Polyoxometalates form a large family of molecular oxide clusters of the early transition metals with unique and tunable properties (multi-redox, thermal and chemical robustness, magnetic). We review more than 30 years of experimental research on the electron transport properties of polyoxometalates devices, from thin films and self-assembled monolayers down to single-molecule junctions. We focus on the relationship between the polyoxometalate structures (structural type, nature of metals and heteroatoms, role of the counterions, redox states, electrode linkers and functional ligands) and the electronic structures of the polyoxometalate-based devices (energy positions of the molecular orbitals, energy offset at the interfaces). Then, we critically discuss the performances of polyoxometalates in nanoelectronics devices: capacitance and resistive switching memories, spintronics, quantum bits and neuromorphic devices. We conclude with a discussion about pending issues and perspectives.

### [Spin splitting torque enabled artificial neuron with self-reset via synthetic antiferromagnetic coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01874v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Badsha Sekh, Hasibur Rahaman, Ravi Shankar Verma et al.*

> Spintronic artificial neurons are intriguing building blocks for energy efficient Neuromorphic Computing (NC). Nevertheless, most contemporary implementations rely on symmetry breaking external in plane magnetic fields (H_X) for neuron operation, which limits scalability and hardware practicality. We experimentally demonstrate an altermagnet/Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Coupling (SAF) based spintronic neuron that uses out of plane spin (σ_Z) polarized spin-splitting torque to eliminate the necessity of an external H_X. The neuron device also features intrinsic self-reset function facilitated by built-in exchange coupling. Furthermore, the proposed device is validated for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) applications by achieving test accuracies of 95.99% and 94.36% on the MNIST and N-MNIST datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the hardware feasibility and compatibility of the proposed spintronic neuron, highlighting its potential for compact, scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems.

### [In-Pipeline Integration of Digital In-Memory-Computing into RISC-V Vector Architecture to Accelerate Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01827v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Tommaso Spagnolo, Cristina Silvano, Riccardo Massa et al.*

> Expanding Deep Learning applications toward edge computing demands architectures capable of delivering high computational performance and efficiency while adhering to tight power and memory constraints. Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) addresses this need by moving part of the computation directly within memory arrays, significantly reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits. The experimental results confirm the high potential of the proposed architecture as a scalable and efficient solution to accelerate Deep Learning inference on the edge.

### [NeuroAI Temporal Neural Networks (NeuTNNs): Microarchitecture and Design Framework for Specialized Neuromorphic Processing Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01546v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Shanmuga Venkatachalam, Prabhu Vellaisamy, Harideep Nair et al.*

> Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.

### [Hardware implementation of photonic neuromorphic autonomous navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01079v1)
**2026-02-01** | *Yonghang Chen, Shuiying Xiang, Xintao Zeng et al.*

> Reinforcement learning (RL) is a core technology enabling the transition of artificial intelligence (AI) from perception to decision-making, but its deployment on conventional electronic hardware suffers from high latency and energy consumption imposed by the von Neumann architecture. Here, we propose a photonic spiking twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning architecture for neuromorphic autonomous navigation and experimentally validate it on a distributed feedback laser with a saturable absorber (DFB-SA) array. The hybrid architecture integrates a photonic spiking Actor network with dual continuous-valued Critic networks, where the final nonlinear spiking activation layer of the Actor is deployed on the DFB-SA laser array. In autonomous navigation tasks, the system achieves an average reward of 58.22 plus-minus 17.29 and a success rate of 80% plus-minus 8.3%. Hardware-software co-inference demonstrates an estimated energy consumption of 0.78 nJ/inf and an ultra-low latency of 191.20 ps/inf, with co-inference error rates of 0.051% and 0.059% in task scenarios with and without obstacle interference, respectively. Simulations for error-activated channels show full agreement with the expected responses, validating the dynamic characteristics of the DFB-SA laser. The architecture shows strong potential for integration with large-scale photonic linear computing chips, enabling fully-functional photonic computation and low-power, low-latency neuromorphic autonomous navigation.

### [System-Level Performance Modeling of Photonic In-Memory Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00892v1)
**2026-01-31** | *Jebacyril Arockiaraj, Sasindu Wijeratne, Sugeet Sunder et al.*

> Photonic in-memory computing is a high-speed, low-energy alternative to traditional transistor-based digital computing that utilizes high photonic operating frequencies and bandwidths. In this work, we develop a comprehensive system-level performance model for photonic in-memory computing, capturing the effects of key latency sources such as external memory access and opto-electronic conversion. We perform algorithm-to-hardware mapping across a range of workloads, including the Sod shock tube problem, Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP), and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation, to evaluate how the latencies impact real-world high-performance computing workloads. Our performance model shows that, while accounting for system overheads, a compact 1x256 bit single-wavelength photonic SRAM array, fabricated using the standard silicon photonics process by GlobalFoundries, sustains up to 1.5 TOPS, 0.9 TOPS, and 1.3 TOPS on the Sod shock tube problem, MTTKRP, and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation with an average energy efficiency of 2.5 TOPS/W.

### [An Open-Source Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Nanoscale Ionic Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00806v1)
**2026-01-31** | *Yichao Wang, Munan Fang, Aziz Roshanbhai Lokhandwala et al.*

> Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.

### [Scalable Memory Sharing in Photonic Quantum Memristors for Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23044v1)
**2026-01-30** | *Chaehyeon Lim, Hyungchul Park, Beomjoon Chae et al.*

> Although photons are robust, room-temperature carriers well suited to quantum machine learning, the absence of photon-photon interactions hinder the realization of memory functionalities that are critical for capturing long-range context. Recently, measurement-based implementations of photonic quantum memristors (PQMRs) have enabled tunable non-Markovian responses. However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability. Our approach paves the way toward high-capacity quantum machine learning using memristive devices compatible with linear-optical quantum computing.

### [Noise-Assisted Metastability: From Lévy Flights to Memristors, Quantum Escape, and Josephson-based Axion Searches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22635v1)
**2026-01-30** | *Claudio Guarcello, Alexander A. Dubkov, Davide Valenti et al.*

> Many-body and complex systems, both classical and quantum, often exhibit slow, nonlinear relaxation toward stationary states due to the presence of metastable configurations and environmental fluctuations. Nonlinear relaxation in a wide variety of natural systems proceeds through metastable states, which arise in condensed-matter physics as well as in fields ranging from cosmology and biology to high-energy physics. Moreover, noise-induced phenomena play a central role in shaping the dynamics of such systems far from equilibrium. This review develops a unifying perspective centered on noise-assisted stabilization and the statistical properties of metastable dynamics. We first discuss escape processes driven by Lévy flights in smooth metastable potentials, emphasizing the emergence of nonmonotonic residence-time behavior. We then connect these concepts to stochastic resistive switching in memristive devices, where noise-induced effects can enhance stability and reproducibility. We further examine driven dissipative quantum bistability, showing how the interplay between external driving and system-environment coupling reshapes escape pathways and lifetimes. Finally, we outline how switching-time statistics in current-biased Josephson junctions can provide an experimentally accessible strategy for axion detection, based on an axion-induced resonant-activation signature.

### [Online unsupervised Hebbian learning in deep photonic neuromorphic networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22300v1)
**2026-01-29** | *Xi Li, Disha Biswas, Peng Zhou et al.*

> While software implementations of neural networks have driven significant advances in computation, the von Neumann architecture imposes fundamental limitations on speed and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.

### [Training slow silicon neurons to control extremely fast robots with spiking reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21548v1)
**2026-01-29** | *Irene Ambrosini, Ingo Blakowski, Dmitrii Zendrikov et al.*

> Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

### [Time Is All It Takes: Spike-Retiming Attacks on Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03284v1)
**2026-02-03** | *Yi Yu, Qixin Zhang, Shuhan Ye et al.*

> Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/yuyi-sd/Spike-Retiming-Attacks.

### [Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing for Edge AI: A Framework with Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks and Hardware-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02439v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz et al.*

> Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.

### [Spark: Modular Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02306v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Mario Franco, Carlos Gershenson*

> Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.

### [Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02281v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Antonino Emanuele Scurria*

> Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.

### [SEDformer: Event-Synchronous Spiking Transformers for Irregular Telemetry Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02230v2)
**2026-02-02** | *Ziyu Zhou, Yuchen Fang, Weilin Ruan et al.*

> Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.

### [Scale-covariant spiking wavelets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02020v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Jens Egholm Pedersen, Tony Lindeberg, Peter Gerstoft*

> We establish a theoretical connection between wavelet transforms and spiking neural networks through scale-space theory. We rely on the scale-covariant guarantees in the leaky integrate-and-fire neurons to implement discrete mother wavelets that approximate continuous wavelets. A reconstruction experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and warrants further analysis to mitigate current approximation errors. Our work suggests a novel spiking signal representation that could enable more energy-efficient signal processing algorithms.

### [SpikingGamma: Surrogate-Gradient Free and Temporally Precise Online Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Smoothed Delays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01978v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Roel Koopman, Sebastian Otte, Sander Bohté*

> Neuromorphic hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, low-latency AI through sparse, event-driven computation. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.

### [Governance at the Edge of Architecture: Regulating NeuroAI and Neuromorphic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01503v1)
**2026-02-02** | *Afifah Kashif, Abdul Muhsin Hameed, Asim Iqbal*

> Current AI governance frameworks, including regulatory benchmarks for accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency, are built for static, centrally trained artificial neural networks on von Neumann hardware. NeuroAI systems, embodied in neuromorphic hardware and implemented via spiking neural networks, break these assumptions. This paper examines the limitations of current AI governance frameworks for NeuroAI, arguing that assurance and audit methods must co-evolve with these architectures, aligning traditional regulatory metrics with the physics, learning dynamics, and embodied efficiency of brain-inspired computation to enable technically grounded assurance.

### [Parallel Training in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01133v1)
**2026-02-01** | *Yanbin Huang, Man Yao, Yuqi Pan et al.*

> The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.

### [ChronoSpike: An Adaptive Spiking Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01124v1)
**2026-02-01** | *Md Abrar Jahin, Taufikur Rahman Fuad, Jay Pujara et al.*

> Dynamic graph representation learning requires capturing both structural relationships and temporal evolution, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods achieve expressiveness at $O(T^2)$ complexity, while recurrent architectures suffer from gradient pathologies and dense state storage. Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $ρ< 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.

### [Matterhorn: Efficient Analog Sparse Spiking Transformer Architecture with Masked Time-To-First-Spike Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22876v1)
**2026-01-30** | *Zhanglu Yan, Kaiwen Tang, Zixuan Zhu et al.*

> Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for energy-efficient LLM inference. However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.

### [Fire on Motion: Optimizing Video Pass-bands for Efficient Spiking Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22675v1)
**2026-01-30** | *Shuhan Ye, Yuanbin Qian, Yi Yu et al.*

> Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction in vision due to their energy efficiency, bio-plausibility, and inherent temporal processing. Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.

### [General Self-Prediction Enhancement for Spiking Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21823v1)
**2026-01-29** | *Zihan Huang, Zijie Xu, Yihan Huang et al.*

> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

### [Error Amplification Limits ANN-to-SNN Conversion in Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21778v1)

> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

### [Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions for Gradient-Free Optimization of Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21572v1)
**2026-01-29** | *Jinhao Li, Yuhao Sun, Zhiyuan Ma et al.*

> Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are a promising substrate for energy-efficient control policies, but training them for high-dimensional, long-horizon reinforcement learning remains challenging. Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.

### [EventFlash: Towards Efficient MLLMs for Event-Based Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03230v1)
**2026-02-03** | *Shaoyu Liu, Jianing Li, Guanghui Zhao et al.*

> Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.

### [Dependence of Equilibrium Propagation Training Success on Network Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21945v1)
**2026-01-29** | *Qingshan Wang, Clara C. Wanjura, Florian Marquardt*

> The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

### [Dynamic Heuristic Neuromorphic Solver for the Edge User Allocation Problem with Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01294v1)
**2026-02-01** | *Kecheng Zhang, Anders Lansner, Ahsan Javed Awan et al.*

> We propose a neuromorphic solver for the NP-hard Edge User Allocation problem using an attractor network with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) mechanism implemented with the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) framework. Unlike previous energy-based attractor networks, our solver uses dynamic heuristic biasing to guide allocations in real time and introduces a "no allocation" state to each WTA motif, achieving near-optimal performance with an empirically upper-bounded number of time steps. The approach is compatible with neuromorphic architectures and may offer improvements in energy efficiency.
